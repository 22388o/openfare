OpenFare is a system for compensating source available project maintainers using the Lightning Network.

The system is composed of two parts:

* a license
* a tool to manage payments across software dependencies.

Software under an OpenFare license is free for non-commercial use. For commercial use, the license defines a payment plan for compensating maintainers.

## Motivation

The open source software ecosystem has a maintenance problem. Thousands of critical software dependencies are maintained on the good will of informal volunteers. This fragile state means that critical software is abandoned or maintained with a passing interest. A security and stability nightmare.

Sponsorship and donation schemes have largely failed. They are not game theoretically viable strategies for addressing the problem.

The solution is to:

* **programmatically manage payment plans** across software dependencies
* seamlessly send micro-payments using the **Lightning Network**.
